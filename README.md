1. Photon_move.m

    __Problem fomulation:__ A photon moving at speed 1 in the x-y plane starts at t=0 at (x,y) = (0.5, 0.1) heading due east. Around every integer lattice point (i, j) in the plane, a circular mirror of radius 1/3 has been erected. How far from the origin is the photon at t=10? Numerically compute the answer, and estimate the condition problem of the answer.
